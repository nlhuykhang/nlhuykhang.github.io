lsof -i: list all opening port

type of records:

- cname
- a record?



- The light-green squares (0, 10, and 127) are blocks that are entirely reserved.
- The dark-green squares are blocks that are partly reserved. For instance, not all of the 192 block is reserved, but some of it is.
- The entire cyan row (starting at 224) is set aside for IP multicast.
- And the entire orange bottom row (starting at 240) was originally set aside for "future use" but was effectively lost due to being blocked as invalid. No, really. We lost 1/16th of all IPv4 addresses due to mistaken planning.
